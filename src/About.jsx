        Hi there!
        Here I am.
        My name is Roberto and I decided to take this course because I have always been passionate about technology.
        I've always wondered, just as I watch a film, another passion of mine, what's behind it?
        How is what I'm watching created?
        How can I make a contribution of my own to create something that we usually see on the screen and take for granted?
        I hope I can go deeper and deeper and always create something new!
      </p>
